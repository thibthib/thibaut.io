For React applications, DOM elements sometimes need to be handled directly. One example is focus management: to give an input element focus without a user clicking on it, you need to call [`input.focus()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/focus). Getting a DOM element in a React app is possible with refs. But new ways to handle refs were released over time, and it became trickier to understand the differences between the various APIs. A couple of weeks ago, while trying to respond to a PR comment, I realized that some of my assumptions about refs were wrong. So let's stop a minute and analyze their evolution !

## 🎈 String refs

The first React refs API was straightforward: **String refs**. Adding a `ref` prop with a string name on any element made it available on your class component:

```jsx
class MyComponent extends Component {
  componentDidMount() {
    this.refs.input.focus();
  }
  render() {
    return <input ref={'input'} />;
  }
}
```

But this API design was not without some issues. For context, look at the [React issue #1373](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/1373) or [this comment from @gaearon](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/8333#issuecomment-271648615) explaining some of the problems. One of them being the inability for two components to put a ref on an element, in case of render props for example. So the React team came up with a new API: **Callback refs**.

_Note: String refs are now considered legacy, and will probably be removed in a future release._

## 📞 Callback refs

This time, a function is passed in the `ref` prop, taking the DOM element as its argument, allowing storage and further usage.

```jsx
class MyComponent extends Component {
  componentDidMount() {
    if (this.input !== null) {
      this.input.focus();
    }
  }
  render() {
    return <input ref={element => (this.input = element)} />;
  }
}
```

With much finer control over how to handle refs, most issues from the Strings refs API are now solved! Two components can have their own ref in a single element. This API is, to date, the most flexible way to handle refs.

But this API design has some flaws. It's a bit more complex than the String refs API, and it has some tricky subtleties. For example, when the `ref` prop is an inline function, [every render calls it twice](https://reactjs.org/docs/refs-and-the-dom.html#caveats-with-callback-refs): first with `null`, then with the element. This is not the case with class methods, but it's easy to forget that we need to check if the element is not `null` before consuming it.

## 🐣 `createRef`

Version 16.3 of React introduced a new `createRef` API. Our previous example has now become:

```jsx
class MyComponent extends Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.inputRef = React.createRef();
  }
  componentDidMount() {
    if (this.inputRef.current !== null) {
      this.inputRef.current.focus();
    }
  }
  render() {
    return <input ref={this.inputRef} />;
  }
}
```

This new API aims to restore the convenience of using String refs without the drawbacks: element assignment to a local variable doesn't have to be handled in every render anymore! We now get a `RefObject` to consume, with a `current` property that holds the DOM element as its TypeScript definition shows:

```ts
interface RefObject<T> {
  readonly current: T | null;
}
```

But a big piece was still missing: function component support.

## 🎣 `useRef`

Along with many other things, React 16.8 brought the new `useRef` hook:

```jsx
const MyComponent = () => {
  const inputRef = React.useRef(null);

  // React.useEffect(fn, []) is the hook way of
  // calling a function when the component mounts
  // See https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-effect.html
  React.useEffect(() => {
    if (inputRef.current !== null) {
      inputRef.current.focus();
    }
  }, []);

  return <input ref={inputRef} />;
};
```

`useRef` can do more than hold a DOM element. It has been designed to hold any value across renders in a function component. It's a replacement of the simple `this.myVariable` from class components. The TypeScript definition of the returned object is a bit different than the one from `createRef`: the `current` property is not `readonly` anymore:

```ts
interface MutableRefObject<T> {
  current: T;
}
```

## ⏩ `forwardRef`

Until now, we've seen how to get refs on elements within a React component. The `forwardRef` API aims to solve another use-case: passing refs between components.

```jsx
const MyInput = React.forwardRef((props, ref) => <input ref={ref} />);

const MyComponent = () => {
  const childRef = React.useRef(null);

  React.useEffect(() => {
    if (childRef.current !== null) {
      childRef.current.focus();
    }
  }, []);

  return <MyInput ref={childRef} />;
};
```

When a component uses `forwardRef`, any parent component can pass to it a `ref` prop in order to get access to an inner element. As the parent component can use `createRef`, `useRef` or callback refs, the `ref` parameter received from `forwardRef` is of a new combined type:

```ts
type Ref<T> = (instance: T | null) => void | RefObject<T> | null;
```

_Note: The [actual TypeScript definition](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/blob/master/types/react/index.d.ts#L84) is in fact slightly different, but [we don't really care here](https://media.giphy.com/media/otnXaUDqh1qta/giphy.gif)_

_Second note: In the future this API [could be simplified](https://github.com/reactjs/rfcs/pull/107), removing the need to use `React.forwardRef` altogether._

## 🎁 `useImperativeHandle`

React refs can handle more than just DOM elements. We already saw they can store mutable values in function components with the `useRef` hook. But they were also designed to handle component instances since the beginning. When adding a `ref` prop to a custom component that doesn't implement `forwardRef`, its instance is returned instead of a DOM element.

With the `useImperativeHandle` hook, we can go even further and decide what our component returns via its `ref` prop, which can be pretty useful for some use-cases. For example, some components need a local ref on an element, as well as forwarding one to its parent. Callback refs can also solve this use-case, but this API simplifies it a lot:

```jsx
const MyInput = React.forwardRef((props, forwardedRef) => {
  const localRef = React.useRef(null);

  React.useEffect(() => {
    if (localRef.current !== null) {
      localRef.current.focus();
    }
  }, []);

  // this way, the local Ref is also exposed as a forwarded one
  React.useImperativeHandle(forwardedRef, () => localRef.current);

  return <input ref={localRef} />;
});
```

## ⚠️ With great power comes great responsability

There are lots of different ways to use refs to get access to a DOM element. But their usage should be very limited to [some specific use-cases](https://reactjs.org/docs/refs-and-the-dom.html#when-to-use-refs). React refs can be seen as an escape hatch: for when the framework fails to provide a declarative API for a use-case. But as such they should only be used when there is no other way.

Thankfully, the React team is aware that focus management [is hard to implement](https://github.com/reactjs/rfcs/issues/104) in React apps, and [new APIs](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/16009) could make it easier in the future. Keep an eye (and contribute) on their repositories to see how this RFC evolves!
