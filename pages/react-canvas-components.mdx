The `<canvas/>` HTML element can be used to draw graphics with a finer control than the usual DOM or SVG. But with React, trying to draw on a canvas is not intuitive as their interfaces are quite different. With React, each component owns their node, as opposed to canvas where there is only one shared node that we can use for drawing. Let's see how we can make a canvas visualization with React components !

## emoji=üßë‚Äçüè´ Canvas 101

The `canvas` element is like a sheet of paper. To draw in real life you would take a pen, move your hand to a first position, and draw a line by moving your hand to another position. The browser API to draw on a canvas is actually very similar. We first need to make a blueprint of the shape we want to draw ‚Äì like using a real pencil ‚Äì that can later be colored in.

```javascript
// moving our hand to the starting position
canvasContext.moveTo(x1, y1);
// drawing a blueprint line to the finishing position
canvasContext.lineTo(x2, y2);
// taking a purple pen and coloring the line
canvasContext.strokeStyle = "purple";
canvasContext.stroke();
```

Having imperative code like this in a component-oriented codebase can be tricky! We would need to create a component that renders a `<canvas/>` on the page and then call the `moveTo` and `lineTo` methods on it to draw a line. In practice, it's a bit more complicated to bridge those two. We need to use a [React reference](https://thibaut.io/react-refs-evolution) to access the canvas DOM node, and to retrieve a 2D context from it; we are then able to call our drawing methods. The code would look like this:

```jsx
const Canvas = () => {
  // we use a ref to access the canvas' DOM node
  const canvasRef = React.useRef(null);

  React.useEffect(() => {
    const context = canvasRef.current.getContext("2d");
    // ...drawing using the context
  }, [canvasRef]);

  return <canvas ref={canvasRef} />;
};
```

<EditOnCodeSandbox
  sandbox={"basic-canvas-hs3cy"}
  fileName={"src/App.js"}
/>

But if we want to draw something a bit more complex, the `Canvas` component can become quite large. Usually, big components are split into several child components. Yet here this is not possible as there is only one `canvas` node.

## emoji=üé® Hexagons

To show how to make child components with canvas, let's draw something more fancy ‚ú®

<InlineRandomHexagons />

A single hexagon is defined with the folowing data:

- A position on the screen ‚Äî two `x` and `y` number values.
- A `radius` to represent its size.
- A `rotation` so that all hexagons don't look aligned.
- A `color`.

We need a function that is able to generate some random hexagons. The randomisation code is not relevant here; let's just assume we have a way to get an array of hexagons. As for how to draw the shape of an hexagon ‚Äì we need to draw a line between all its corners and then fill it with a color:

```jsx
// This article explains all the math behind hexagons
// https://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons/
const corners = getHexagonCorners(x, y, radius, rotation);

context.beginPath();
corners.forEach((corner, index) => {
  if (index === 0) {
    context.moveTo(corner.x, corner.y);
  } else {
    context.lineTo(corner.x, corner.y);
  }
});
context.fillStyle = color;
context.fill();
```

How could we extract this logic into its own `Hexagon` component? The component would need the canvas's context in order to draw anything. This could be passed via a prop to all child components, but this approach can become tedious when children are deeply nested. Another way of doing this is by using a [React context](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html) to share "global" values between components.

## emoji=üì¶ A context in a context

At this point the naming gets a bit tricky as we are trying to share a canvas' _context_ via a React _context_. Once we create a React context, we need to use the context's `Provider` to share a value. In the case of our `Canvas` component it would look like this:

```jsx
// we create a React context with a _null_ default value
const SharingContext = React.createContext(null);

const Canvas = (props) => {
  const canvasRef = React.useRef(null);
  const [renderingContext, setRenderingContext] =
    React.useState(null);

  // the canvas rendering context is not immediately avalaible
  // the canvas node first needs to be added to the DOM by react
  React.useEffect(() => {
    const context2d = canvasRef.current.getContext("2d");
    setRenderingContext(context2d);
  }, []);

  return (
    <SharingContext.Provider value={renderingContext}>
      <canvas ref={canvasRef} />
      {/* hexagons are passed through the `children` prop */}
      {props.children}
    </SharingContext.Provider>
  );
};
```

<EditOnCodeSandbox
  sandbox={"hexagons-30dkf"}
  fileName={"src/Canvas.js"}
/>

The `Hexagon` component needs to consume this React context to read its value ‚Äì here with the `useContext` hook.

```jsx
const Hexagon = (props) => {
  // we get the rendering context by comsuming the React context
  const renderingContext = React.useContext(SharingContext);

  if (renderingContext !== null) {
    // hexagon drawing logic
  }
};
```

<EditOnCodeSandbox
  sandbox={"hexagons-30dkf"}
  fileName={"src/Hexagon.js"}
/>

Now that both our `Canvas` and `Hexagon` components are ready we are able to display randomly-generated hexagons:

```jsx
const App = () => (
  <Canvas>
    {getRandomHexagons().map((hexagon) => (
      <Hexagon {...hexagon} />
    ))}
  </Canvas>
);
```

<EditOnCodeSandbox
  sandbox={"hexagons-30dkf"}
  fileName={"src/App.js"}
/>

The last thing we need is to animate the hexagons so that they rotate.

## emoji=üé¨ Animations

As we saw, the canvas is like a sheet of paper ‚Äì once it's been drawn on, it can't be changed! However, a canvas can be cleared in order that something new can be draw on it. In that respect animating a canvas is somewhat like old-fashioned cartoon animation - we draw, clean, draw, clean and repeat until we achieve the desired effect. To make a shape move, you need to split the movement into small steps, draw them one by one, while clearing the canvas in-between. Those steps are called frames. Browsers come with an API `requestAnimationFrame` so that you can draw in each frame.

### emoji=üñº Creating a frame loop

First things first - the canvas should be cleared at the beginning of each frame. The easiest way to do this is to have an internal state counting the frames. This way, the component re-renders at each frame:

```jsx
const [frameCount, setFrameCount] = React.useState(0);
// this effect increments frameCount by one at the next frame
// as it's called every time frameCount changes
// this makes the Canvas component re-render at every frame
React.useEffect(() => {
  const frameId = requestAnimationFrame(() => {
    setFrameCount(frameCount + 1);
  });
  return () => {
    cancelAnimationFrame(frameId);
  };
}, [frameCount, setFrameCount]);

// here's the clearing at every render ‚Äî at every frame.
if (context !== null) {
  context.clearRect(0, 0, actualWidth, actualHeight);
}
```

<EditOnCodeSandbox
  sandbox={"animated-hexagons-v9j2q"}
  fileName={"src/Canvas.js"}
/>

But... the canvas is now white! This is because the hexagons are only rendered once - when `<RandomHexagons/>` is first rendered. But, as the canvas is cleared on each frame, the hexagons are erased once the next render occurs. Child components must be forced to re-render and draw in the canvas on every frame. One solution is to share the `frameCount` from the canvas with the `Hexagon` component. This is achieved via a React context, like we did with `SharingContext`:

```jsx
const FrameContext = React.createContext(0);

const Canvas = (props) => {
  // [...]
  return (
    <SharingContext.Provider value={renderingContext}>
      <FrameContext.Provider value={frameCount}>
        <canvas />
        {props.children}
      </FrameContext.Provider>
    </SharingContext.Provider>
  );
};
```

```jsx
const Hexagon = (props) => {
  const renderingContext = React.useContext(SharingContext);
  const frameCount = React.useContext(FrameContext);
  // drawing logic
};
```

And now our hexagons are back on the screen! üéâ While this method works, the `FrameContext` has to be added to every child component. Two options are available to make sure that this context is used everywhere that `SharingContext` is:

- We can regroup them into a single context that shares both the `renderingContext` and the `frameCount`. But the `frameCount` variable is not used in the child components, so it does not make sense to share its value.

- Or, we can create a `useCanvas` hook to hide this complexity away! Even when consuming both React contexts, the hook can only return the canvas rendering context to the child components:

```jsx
export const useCanvas = () => {
  React.useContext(FrameContext);
  const renderingContext = React.useContext(CanvasContext);
  return renderingContext;
};
```

The `Hexagon` component logic now needs a small update to use this new hook:

```jsx
const Hexagon = (props) => {
  const renderingContext = useCanvas();
  // drawing logic
};
```

### emoji=üîÑ Making the hexagons move

If we want the hexagons to rotate, each hexagon should change its rotation angle at every frame - by incrementing it by 1, for example. To do this, the hexagons needs to _remember_ the rotation from the previous render. We will use a [React ref](/react-refs-evolution) to achieve this:

```jsx
const animatedRotation = React.useRef(props.rotation);
animatedRotation.current = animatedRotation.current + 1;
```

As the `Hexagon` component re-renders at every frame, this code makes its rotation change at every frame: they rotate! üòç

Like we did with `useCanvas`, we can also improve the readability of this code by hiding the implementation details ‚Äì here, using a React ref ‚Äì in a hook:

```jsx
const useAnimation = (initialValue, valueUpdater) => {
  const animatedValue = React.useRef(initialValue);
  animatedValue.current = valueUpdater(
    animatedValue.current
  );
  return animatedValue.current;
};
```

<EditOnCodeSandbox
  sandbox={"animated-hexagons-v9j2q"}
  fileName={"src/Canvas.js"}
/>

The `Hexagon` code now looks a bit better:

```jsx
const Hexagon = (props) => {
  // [...]
  const animatedRotation = useAnimation(
    props.rotation,
    (angle) => angle + 1
  );
  // drawing logic
};
```

<EditOnCodeSandbox
  sandbox={"animated-hexagons-v9j2q"}
  fileName={"src/Hexagon.js"}
/>

üëè Congratulations üëè We now have animated canvas-based React components! We even created two custom hooks along the way to make our code nicer.

## emoji=üëÄ Going further

- At some point it can become quite CPU heavy to try to animate a lot of shapes in a canvas. At this point, there's another more performant way to draw things: WebGL. This is a huge subject on its own! If you want to write WebGL-based components, I would recommend using a library like [react-three-fiber](https://github.com/react-spring/react-three-fiber) _‚Äî spoiler alert, they made their own React reconciler_

- Our `useAnimation` hook does not help if we want to animate stuff other than infinitely changing numbers. To create more complex things, [react-spring](https://github.com/react-spring/react-spring) is the library to go to. It needs a bit of wiring to make it work with our own frame loop ‚Äì [here's how to get it working with `react-three-fiber` for example](https://github.com/react-spring/react-spring/blob/bdf8afb8b2d837fd756f8ffaae6931fb15c0e3d2/src/targets/three/index.ts#L24-L25).
